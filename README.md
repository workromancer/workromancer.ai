## 🚨 The Problem

Every time a key employee leaves your organization, critical knowledge walks out the door with them:

- **💔 Knowledge Drain**: Years of institutional knowledge, project context, and decision-making rationale disappear forever
- **📉 Stalled Projects**: Teams struggle without understanding the 'why' behind past decisions, leading to delays and costly mistakes
- **⏰ Inefficient Onboarding**: New hires spend months piecing together context that could have been preserved instantly

---

**Workromancer is your institutional memory, supercharged by AI.**

Our platform captures and contextualizes the collective knowledge of your employees, making it instantly accessible and actionable—long after they're gone.
